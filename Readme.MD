Homebridge-tuya is a homebridge plugin that lets you control your Tuya based devices with Homekit. 

Some devices may not be supported. Please check the common issues tab in the wiki for more info. 


## Installation 
To use this plugin, follow the steps below:

1) Install [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge), if you haven't already.

2) Install this plugin. You may need to prefix this command with ```sudo``` if you run into any issues.

```npm i -g homebridge-tuya-curtain-shade```

3) Add your device's parameters to your ```config.json``` file, then reload Homebridge.

To find your devices configuration parameters, please look at the Wiki.

**Note** The wiki has some inconsitencies with V1 and 2. I will fix this, I justt need to wait for V2, before it's all up-to-date.
